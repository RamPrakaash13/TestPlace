    <p class="story1">This happened last spring, or maybe late winter, it's getting really hard to nail down but it was definitely this year.

        I was out walking the foster dog on an overcast day, totally routine and thinking random thoughts, but mostly hoping he wouldn't see a cat so that we could just wrap things up without a dog rodeo. He's a big dog.
        
        So, walking the dog, gray day, taking in the quiet and I'm staring straight ahead as one of the trees ahead of me disappears. As it happens I also feel off, like a sudden pressure change in a plane. I immediately feel like I saw something I shouldn't have, recognize the weirdness of that particular thought and know that no one will believe me if I ask about a random tree. Plus, it just sounds nuts, even as I'm thinking it. It was a lot at once, in what must have been only a few seconds.
        
        This particular tree was one of several along the driveway, but still off to the side a bit on its own. It's not like I was staring into the woods and shifted focus. I'm still conscious of its absence and it's super frustrating.</p>
